<h1>The Best Movies According to TingFeng</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>

<h3>The Terminator</h3>
<p>Thrilling Sci-Fi movie with Arnold nailing the charactor of a robot assassin.</p>

<h3>Full River Red</h3>
<p>Funny yet serious at the same time. Struck a chord with me, coming from a school which places the utmost importance on Chinese heritage</p>

<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>Epic action packed movies with all my favourite Marvel superheroes</p>
